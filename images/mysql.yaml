    required: true

  MYSQL_DATABASE:
    description: Allows you to specify the name of a database to be created on image startup. If a user/password was supplied (see below) then that user will be granted superuser access (corresponding to [`GRANT ALL`](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/adding-users.html)) to this database.

  MYSQL_USER:
    description: Used to create a new user. This user will be granted superuser permissions (see above) for the database specified by the `MYSQL_DATABASE` variable. `MYSQL_PASSWORD` must be set for this to take effect.

  MYSQL_PASSWORD:
    description: Used to set that user's password. `MYSQL_USER` must be set for this to take effect.

  MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD:
    description: Set to a non-empty value, like `yes`, to allow the container to be started with a blank password for the root user.

  MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD:
    description: "Set to a non-empty value, like `yes`, to generate a random initial password for the root user (using `pwgen`). The generated root password will be printed to stdout (`GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: .....`)"

  MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD:
    description: "Sets root (not the user specified in `MYSQL_USER`!) user as expired once init is complete, forcing a password change on first login. Any non-empty value will activate this setting.

  MYSQL_INITDB_SKIP_TZINFO:
    description: By default, the entrypoint script automatically loads the timezone data needed for the `CONVERT_TZ()` function. If it is not needed, any non-empty value disables timezone loading.
